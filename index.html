        <h2>Father of Constitution</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar</b>, a multifaceted Indian scholar, jurist, economist, and social reformer, was born on April 14, 1891, in Mhow, Madhya Pradesh. He's popularly known as the "Architect of the Indian Constitution" due to his crucial role in drafting it as the Chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Constituent Assembly. A Dalit leader and social activist, he fought tirelessly against caste discrimination and championed the rights of marginalized communities. Ambedkar also served as India's first Law Minister. 
Early Life and Education:
Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar was born into a Mahar family, a Dalit caste, and experienced significant discrimination throughout his life. 
He received his early education in Bombay and later pursued higher studies at Elphinstone College, graduating with a degree in Political Science and Economics from Bombay University in 1912. 
He received a scholarship from the ruler of Baroda and subsequently pursued further studies in the US and UK, earning doctorates in economics from both Columbia University and the London School of Economics. 
Key Contributions:
Drafting the Indian Constitution:
Ambedkar's leadership and expertise as the Chairman of the Drafting Committee were instrumental in shaping India's constitution, ensuring the inclusion of principles of equality, social justice, and individual rights. 
Social Reform and Dalit Rights:
He dedicated his life to fighting caste-based discrimination and promoting social equality, advocating for equal rights and opportunities for Dalits. 
Championing Equality:
Ambedkar established various institutions and journals to promote education and socio-economic upliftment of the Dalits, actively agitating for their rights and challenging the caste system. 
Poona Pact:
He played a significant role in the Poona Pact, an agreement that resulted in reserved seats for the depressed classes in the legislative councils. 
Buddhism:
In 1956, he converted to Buddhism, initiating mass conversions of Dalits and advocating for the revival of Buddhism in India. 
Legacy:
Ambedkar's legacy continues to inspire movements for equality and justice in India and beyond, with numerous memorials and depictions in popular culture acknowledging his contributions.
In 1990, he was posthumously awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, in recognition of his achievements.
